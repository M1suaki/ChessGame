# Chess Game Project

## Overview
This project is a fully functional chess game developed as part of a class project during Spring 2023. The game was created collaboratively with a partner and serves as a demonstration of object-oriented programming concepts and collaborative software development techniques.

## Features
- **Two-Player Functionality**: Supports two players alternating turns.
- **Standard Chess Rules**: Implements the rules of chess, including valid piece movements, check, and checkmate.
- **Graphical Representation**: Displays the chessboard and pieces in a user-friendly interface.
- **Move Validation**: Ensures all moves are valid according to chess rules.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub for collaboration and version tracking
- **Design**: UML diagrams for planning and visualization

## Project Structure
- `src/`: Contains the source code organized into appropriate packages.
- `docs/`: Includes UML diagrams and other documentation.
- `tests/`: Contains test cases for validating game logic.
## Lessons Learned
- **Collaboration**: Effective use of Git and GitHub for teamwork.
- **Design**: Importance of UML diagrams in planning complex systems.
- **Problem-Solving**: Addressing challenges in implementing chess rules and move validation.

## Challenges
- Implementing complex chess rules like castling and en passant.
- Managing edge cases in move validation.

## Future Enhancements
- Add single-player mode with AI opponent.
- Implement game-saving and loading functionality.
- Enhance the graphical user interface.

## Acknowledgments
This project was completed as part of the curriculum for CS 3354, Object-Oriented Programming with my partner Aliyah Melendez. Special thanks to my professor Li Xiomin for guidance and support throughout the project.
